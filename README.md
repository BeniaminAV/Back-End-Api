# Back-End-Api
Node-js, Express, Typescript, Nodemon


I have developed a Node.js backend application using Express, Typescript, and Nodemon, which displays API endpoints for posts and comments in the browser.

To start the application, you can use the following command: npm start.

http:localhost:5000/posts -> all posts
<br/>
http:localhost:5000/comments -> all comments
